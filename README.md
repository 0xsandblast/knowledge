# Introduction
## Summary
\[...\]
## IT (security) Knowledge Base
This repository aims to list about everything I learned in general purposes IT, with a focus on security. It contains both academical and personnal projects as I give them the same importance, and I try to be as exhaustive as concise when describing them. Also, I strongly believe that the best way to ensure the comprehension of a subject is to teach it.

## The big Why
I got into computers firstly because my father is an IT engineer himself, and I have somehow been in it progressively since I was at middle school. What I like the most about computers is this infinite range of possibilities which leaves room for creativity \[...\] and solving complex problems (I was raised with Legos and Rubik's Cube. Oh, and also a Nintendo DS Lite).
